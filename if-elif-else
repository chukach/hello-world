My task is to a)store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list. b)Loop through the list c)use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to
print the proper ordinal ending for each number. So the ouput should read 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th but with each in 
its own line. In Python3
This is what I have so far but it is not working.

ordinals= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for ordinal in ordinals:
    print(ordinal)
if ordinal == 1:
    ending = 'st'
if ordinal == 2:
    ending = 'nd'
if ordinal == 3:
    ending = 'rd'
else:
    ending = 'th'
print(ordinal + str(ending))

Apparently this is wrong. Help
