# hello-world.py
I am a newbie and the purpose of this repository is to share what I am learning and ask questions where I am confused especially Python.
HEllo guys. My name is Chuka. A month ago, I began my journey towards becoming a developer. I started with HTML/CSS. I am now learning to code in Python. I put in work into the learning process everyday despite my demanding military job. My education consists of a B.Sc in Accounting and MBA in Aviation. No prior knowledge of programming.I will definitely need help getting myself unstuck. I hope to collaborate and use this platform to its fullest potential as soon as I get a handle on how the platform works. Thanks and I look forward to interacting with you all.
